# PySparkInAction

This is the companion repository for the _PySpark In Action_ book (Manning,
estimated publishing date: end of 2020.) It contains the source code and data
(or data download scripts if pertinent).

Right now, Chapter 2 and 3 are available (Chapter 6 has no external source code
at the moment).

I plan to add exercise solutions as I go along. Stay tuned!


## Mistakes or omissions

If you encounter mistakes in the book manuscript (including the printed source
code), please use the Manning platform to provide feedback.
